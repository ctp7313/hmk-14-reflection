# Project #2 Reflection
Reflections on the Helping Hands project.

## What Went Well
Overall, our team dynamic was strong. We unfortunately lost Ruth but gained Nick and he's been a pleasure to work with. I think we all settled into our roles quite naturally from our first project together, the Washington State Voter Dashboard, which found me back in the PM seat. I've always enjoyed PM'ing, usually being the friend that handles the logistics and planning for any trip or get-together, so a lot of the tasks came second nature. 

I'd be remiss if I didn't say I was looking forward to handling more coding responsibilities, but with such a short timeline like we had for this project, it's best to play to our strengths, no? For this project, I built the organization submissions page, but the rest of my responsibilities lied with keeping track of our progress and trying to get us to meet certain milestones and delegate tasks. Post boot camp, I see myself doing well in these roles, or at the very least, I feel very comfortable in them.

## What Didn't Go Well
There were definitely some struggles with the project, as evidenced by the fact that our application did not work when it was time to present.

I think the biggest one was the fact that our deployment happened far too late, which made for a poor demo. Pushing out deployment gave us room to spin wheels on future development instead of focusing on functionality. Without going too much into detail, I look forward to the next project to do the following:

* Working backwards, set goals to allow for ample time for testing
* Advocate and stand firm for the milestones
* Do a better job of delegating and checking in with others to spread work around.
* Test,test,test! Making sure we pass tests before going the next stage of development. 

## Closing
Going into the next project, I feel it's likely I'll be designated as the PM again and I'm content with that. It may mean I'm doing less coding, but if I'm to do this, I should do it well and focus on creating a strong plan for the team. This will involve learning or researching development cycles and other project management methods and best practices suited for web development.
